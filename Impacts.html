        <h1>The Hidden Cost <br> of Ocean Pollution</h1>
        <p>From marine life to human health, pollution affects everyone.</p>

    <h1>Introduction to <span>Impacts</span> of Ocean Pollution</h1>
    <p>The consequences of ocean pollution extend beyond environmental degradation to affect human health, food security, and global economies. The oceans, which cover more than 70% of the Earth’s surface, play a critical role in regulating the planet’s climate and supporting biodiversity. Polluting this system has long-term ecological and socio-economic repercussions.</p>

            <h1 id="marine">Marine Life Mortality and Habitat Loss</h1><br>
            <p>PSea animals are frequent victims of ocean pollution. <a href="Sources.html#oil">Oil spills</a>, for instance, will ensnare and suffocate marine animals by permeating their gills. When the oil gets into seabird feathers, they may not be able to fly or feed their young. Animals that aren’t killed by crude oil may suffer from cancer and behavioral changes and become unable to reproduce.
                <br><br>Marine animals also mistake small <a href="Sources.html#plastic">plastic debris</a> for food or become entangled in or strangled by plastic bags and discarded fishing nets. Animals most vulnerable to harm from plastic debris in the ocean include dolphins, fish, sharks, turtles, seabirds and crabs.
                <br><br>Additionally, Oil spill floats on the surface of the water and prevents sunlight from reaching to marine plants and affects the process of photosynthesis. Skin irritation, eye irritation, lung and liver problems can impact marine life over a long period of time.</p><br><hr>
            <h1 id="chain">Food Chain Contamination</h1><br>
            <p><a href="Sources.html#chemical">Chemicals</a> used in industries and <a href="Sources.html#runoff">agriculture</a> get washed into the rivers and from there are carried into the oceans. These chemicals do not get dissolved and sink at the bottom of the ocean. Small animals ingest these chemicals and are later eaten by large animals, which then affects the whole food chain.
                <br><br>Animals from impacted food chain are then eaten by humans, which affects their health as toxins from these contaminated animals get deposited in the tissues of people and can lead to cancer, birth defects or long term health problems.</p><br><hr>
            <img src="image/climate1.jpeg" class="img-fluid">
            <h1 id="oxygen">Oxygen Depletion and Dead Zones</h1><br>
            <p>As excess debris in the ocean slowly degrades over many years, it uses oxygen to do so, resulting in less oxygen in the ocean. Low levels of oxygen in the ocean lead to the death of ocean animals such as penguins, dolphins, whales and sharks.
                <br><br>Excess nitrogen and phosphorus in seawater also cause oxygen depletion. When a great deal of oxygen depletion occurs in an area of the ocean, it can become a dead zone where very little marine life can survive.</p><br><hr>
            <h1 id="climate">Climate and Economic Impacts</h1><br>
            <p>Ocean pollution and climate change are inextricably linked, forming a dangerous feedback loop that exacerbates both problems. Pollution degrades the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide, weakens its role in regulating global temperature, and directly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating the impacts of climate change.
                <br><br>The economic impact of ocean pollution is vital because it affects local and global economies, especially those dependent on marine resources. Fisheries decline occurs when pollution and overfishing reduce fish stocks, affecting food security and creating ripple effects on communities whose livelihoods rely on fishing. As stocks drop, regulations change, leading to income loss for fishermen and higher food prices. Pollution also harms tourism, as many regions depend on clean beaches and healthy marine life to attract visitors. When environmental health declines, tourist numbers fall, causing job losses, economic damage, and negative public perception. Overall, the impacts of ocean pollution extend beyond the environment and pose serious human health and economic concerns.<br></p><br><hr>
