    <h1>Design impacts in Pages</h1>
    <h3>1- Colors</h3>
    <p><i>The pages used various colors types, but it relies heavily on blue and white</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Dark Blue #2163C5 with White Background:</b> main heading, images and backgrounds in home page</li>
      <li><b>Light Blue #0d6efd with White Background:</b> subheading and their descriptions in home page</li>
      <li><b>White #ffffff with #2163C5, #0d6efd and Blue Images:</b> both main heading and subheading used in all pages around banners, and navigation bars</li>
    </ul>
    <p>those colors used to reflect the importance of ocean conservation. Furthermore, by combining blue and white background we create a visually appealing look across the entire home page and ensure easy readability</p>
    <p>in the content page (three sub topics). We divided the page into two colors so that we separate the two pages into references (light gray) content and main content (white). Moreover, we used the black color text in both main heading and their descriptions, Because black text gives the highest contrast on light backgrounds, making information easier to read, clearer, and more accessible for all users. Also we used the gray color in all the pages for their introductions/overview</p>
    <h3>2- Interaction</h3>
    <p><i>Several interactive features are implemented to allow visitors to engage with the website:</i></p>
    <ol>
      <li>The current page in navigation bar is highlighted in white, while inactive links remain gray for easy differentiation.</li>
      <li>Buttons in home page such as "Contact Us" and "Sources, Impacts, Solutions Pages" uses hover transitions.</li>
      <li>Navigation bar (light gray) and buttons (background white and text black) changes their colors when on hover.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All those features are added to improve the user engagement across all Web pages.</p>
    <h3>3- Consistency of Layout</h3>
    <p>Sections are aligned and spaced using Bootstrap's grid system. For example, 4-column layout for icons Home Page, 3-column layout for the menu Home Page, 3-column layout for .sources-info with 9-column for .content Sub topics pages. When viewed on smaller screens, these columns stack smoothly, preserving readability and structure.</p>
    <h1>Impact of HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap on Maintainability</h1>
    <p><i>The Structure of HTML is designed in clean and organized way that makes the website easy to maintain and develop. On the other hand, the CSS ensures visual consistency across the entire website and makes styling changes extremely efficient. Furthermore, using javascript and bootstrap to enhance the interaction and register form.</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Reusability:</b> If we want to add more HTML pages we can easily reuse the class. For example, we can reuse the footer class across all the pages</li>
      <li><b>Unified layout:</b> All the pages follow a consistent layout. For instance, all the pages consist of Navigation then Banner then Content and last is footer. Thus, the developer can quickly update the site and reduce its confusion. </li>
      <li><b>Semantic Structure:</b> The HTML and CSS uses clearly named classes that describe their purpose. For example, a class such as .banner immediately tells the developer that this section controls the banner area. This improves readability, reduces the need for documentation, and helps developers understand the function of each part of the page at a glance.</li>
      <li><b>External CSS File:</b> this CSS feature uses a one CSS external file that contains all the designs. for example, if we want to change the font color in banner class for the entire web, we can easily refer to stylesheet file and change it. This ensures no time is wasted and easy maintenance.</li>
      <li><b>Repeated Use of Functions:</b> JavaScript uses a function to repeat in case the developer wants to use the function again. For example, the developer can use the display function again to display the visitor's name anywhere on a page and on any page they want.</li>
      <li><b>Easy Responsive:</b> using the bootstrap rather than the CSS it will give the page responsive feature for every size of device. For example, we use the navbar bootstrap class to give the best responsive. This can help the developers by reducing the size of codes in CSS. </li>
    </ul>
