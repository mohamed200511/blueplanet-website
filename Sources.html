  <h1>Introduction to <span>Sources</span> of Ocean Pollution</h1>
  <p>Ocean pollution is primarily a result of human activity that introduces harmful substances into the marine environment. These pollutants originate from both land-based and ocean-based sources and include plastics, chemicals, oil, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), approximately 80% of marine pollution originates from land-based sources, making it a pressing environmental issue that threatens biodiversity, human health, and economic stability.</p>

      <h1 id="plastic">Plastic Pollution</h1><br>
      <p>Plastic debris is a pervasive pollutant found in oceans worldwide. It encompasses a range of materials, including single-use plastics and microplastics. One key aspect of plastic debris is its durability; it does not decompose easily. This can lead to long-term environmental concerns as plastics persist in marine habitats.
        <br><br>Moreover, plastic pollution can harm <a href="Impacts.html#marine">marine organisms</a> through ingestion and entanglement. Sea turtles, for example, often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. This not only affects animal health but can also disrupt marine <a href="Impacts.html#chain">food webs</a>. Reducing <a href="Solutions.html#reducep">single-use</a> plastics and enhancing waste management are crucial steps to address this pollutant.</p><br><hr>
      <h1 id="chemical">Chemical and Industrial Waste</h1><br>
      <p>Industrial and agricultural waste is another most common form of wastes that is directly discharged into the oceans, resulting in ocean pollution.
        <br><br>The dumping of toxic liquids in the ocean directly affects <a href="Impacts.html#marine">marine life</a> as they are considered hazardous, and secondly, they <a href="Impacts.html#climate">raise the temperature</a> of the ocean, a phenomenon known as thermal pollution, as the temperature of these liquids is quite high. Animals and plants that cannot survive at higher temperatures eventually perish.</p><br><hr>
      <h1 id="runoff">Agricultural Runoff</h1><br>
      <p>Agricultural runoff is a significant environmental concern that arises from the application of fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals in farming practices. When it rains or when irrigation occurs, these substances can wash off the fields and enter nearby water bodies, leading to a range of ecological issues. As you delve into the complexities of agricultural runoff, you will discover how it not only affects local water quality but also has far-reaching implications for <a href="Impacts.html#marine">marine ecosystems</a> and global health.
        <br><br>The impact of agricultural runoff extends beyond the immediate vicinity of farms. It can lead to nutrient pollution, which is characterized by an excess of nitrogen and phosphorus in water bodies.
        <br><br>This nutrient overload can trigger harmful algal blooms, which deplete <a href="Impacts.html#oxygen">oxygen levels</a> in the water and create dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive.</p><br><hr>
      <img src="image/oil.jpg" class="img-fluid">
      <h1 id="oil">Oil Spills and Marine Transportation</h1><br>
      <p>Ship pollution is a huge source of ocean pollution, the most devastating effect of which is oil spills. Crude oil lasts for years in the sea and is extremely toxic to <a href="Impacts.html#marine">marine life</a>, often suffocating marine animals to death once it entraps them. Crude oil is also extremely difficult to clean up, unfortunately, meaning that when it is split, it is usually there to stay.
        <br><br>Besides, many ships lose thousands of crates each year due to storms, emergencies, and accidents. This causes noise pollution (excessive, unexpected noise that interrupts the balance of life, most often caused by modes of transportation), excessive algae, and ballast water.
        <br><br>Often, other species can also invade an ecosystem and do harm to it by interrupting the life cycles of other organisms, causing a clash of nature that has already been damaged by the overflow of pollution.</p><br><hr>
      <h1 id="sewage">Sewage and Urban Wastewater</h1><br>
      <p>Pollution can enter the ocean directly. Sewage or polluting substances flow through sewage, rivers, or drainages directly into the ocean. This is often how minerals and substances from mining camps find their way into the ocean.
        <br><br>The release of other chemical nutrients into the ocean’s ecosystem leads to reductions in <a href="Impacts.html#oxygen">oxygen levels</a>, the decay of plant life, and a severe decline in the quality of the seawater itself. As a result, all levels of oceanic life, plants and animals, are highly affected.</p><br><hr>
