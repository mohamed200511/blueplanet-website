      <h3>1. Mohammed (202305535)</h3>
      <p>My role focused on shaping the overall look, layout, and structure of the Blue Planet Awareness website.
        I worked on designing consistent page layouts, selecting colour themes, and ensuring every page followed a
        cohesive visual identity. I also organised the content for the six main pages, including Home, Sources,
        Impacts, and Solutions, making sure the information was clear and educational.</p>
      <p>One challenge I faced was ensuring the colour palette and typography worked well across the website.
        Maintaining consistency required extensive testing and adjusting margins, spacing, and text sizes.
        Through this process, I learned the importance of detailed design planning and how much visual organisation
        contributes to a positive user experience.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-4">2. Umer (202301466) </h3>
      <p>I focused on making the website fully responsive and user-friendly. Using Bootstrap’s grid system, I ensured
        that the pages displayed correctly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Many sections—especially
        banners and images—required adjustments to avoid stretching or misalignment.</p>
      <p>A major challenge was fixing banner images on mobile screens. Some appeared distorted at first, but by using
        <code>background-size: cover;</code> and <code>background-position: center;</code>, I made sure they displayed
        well on all devices. I gained a deeper understanding of Bootstrap utilities and responsive web design.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-4">3. Saqlain (202302015)</h3>
      <p>My main responsibility was building and refining the interactive elements of the website, especially the
        contact form on the Home page. I implemented JavaScript validation to check that users entered correct
        information, such as an eight-digit phone number and non-empty fields. I also supported navigation fixes
        and smaller functionality improvements.</p>
      <p>One challenge I faced was balancing good functionality with a clean, simple user design. The form needed
        to be helpful without overwhelming users. Through refining my approach, I strengthened my skills in writing
        efficient and user-friendly JavaScript.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-4">4. Shahd (202301699)</h3>
      <p>I was responsible for researching accurate information and writing clear content for the Sources, Impacts,
        and Solutions pages. I used credible organisations such as UNEP, NOAA, and UNESCO to make sure the facts
        were reliable and informative. I also wrote text that was accessible, engaging, and easy to understand.</p>
      <p>The biggest challenge was simplifying complex environmental topics without losing important meaning. This
        taught me how essential clear communication is—especially for subjects like ocean pollution that require
        public awareness and action.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-4">Conclusion – A Combined Effort</h3>
      <p>Together, we created Blue Planet Awareness as an opportunity to learn web development while raising
        awareness about ocean pollution. Each team member contributed different strengths—design, research,
        coding, and layout—and the final website represents the result of teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving.
        This project helped us grow individually while creating something meaningful as a group.</p>
